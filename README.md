# 30 days of python
Learn python in 30 days 

The following tutorial is designed based on my experiance on python for couple of years. This would reduce the learning curve for people who like to learn python. I have added resources, book suggestion, interview question and lot more.

## Array | Day 1

### Declaring array in Python

`foods =['Briyani', 'Noodles', 'Sandwich', 'Burger']`

### accesing the array

`get_array = foods[0]`

get **Noodles** in the foods array. The value is called based on the index position.

### length of the array

`length_array = len(foods)`

get the total (N values) number of values in the array. In which foods as length of 4.

### append value to the array

`foods.append("Pizza")`

add **Pizza** to the list of values in food array. Append always add value to the last.

### removing value from the array

`foods.pop(2)`

remove the value in foods array based on the index position.

`foods.remove("Burger")`

remove **Burger** from the foods array.
